# better_news_classifier
You can use this model to classifier news articles model accuracy is over 96%
#### categories are:
business, entertainment, politics, science, sport and tech
I use bbc dataset to train and test model http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html
I also added about 400 science articles from web free to use

## Usage:
1. First run data2csv.py it cleans data and  creates csv file
2, then run train_model.py create word vectors, trains and test model. Finally it saves all in pkl files
3 then you can run news_category_model.py and test model in action
