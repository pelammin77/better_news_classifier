Never thought a stupid lil wrist computer I bought 2 years ago would save my life. Saw my ❤️ rate go up, ended up being a pulmonary embolism pic.twitter.com/r97uRcX0En — renata’s eyepatch (@_jamestgreen) October 13, 2017

It’s hard to imagine how a wristwatch could save you from certain death – but James Green’s Apple Watch is the reason why he is still alive.

The Brooklyn reporter and podcast host got a notification last week from his Heart Watch app saying that his heart rate was higher than usual. Despite sitting at his desk for several hours, his heart never fell below his usual resting rate of 54.

The notification, along with a few other symptoms that Green had noticed during the week, prompted him to visit a doctor.

A CT scan then showed that the 28-year-old New Yorker had a pulmonary embolism in his lungs, which – if ignored for any longer – would have been fatal.

A pulmonary embolism occurs when arteries within the lungs are blocked by blood clots. Thanks to Green’s early notice of the condition, he was treated with blood thinners to break up the clots.

Green gave a shoutout to the life-saving app on Twitter, thanking them for saving his life.

The Heart Watch Twitter account responded by saying: “Thanks! Also wow! This is so fantastic that you are ok. Humbled to have played a part. Wishing you a rapid recovery & best of future health.”
